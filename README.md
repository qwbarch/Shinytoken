# ShinyToken
[This mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shiny-token) is for use with Pixelmon Reforged.

Shiny Tokens is a mod that allows you to convert pokemon to shiny with the use of a "token".  
Tokens are obtained only through command however, so this mod is recommended to be used with mods that rewards commands.  
Check out [pixeldex](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixeldex "pixeldex") if you'd like to reward shiny tokens through pokedex completion.   

A configurable drop-rate can be set through the configuration file. By default, tokens drop at a 5% chance by defeating shiny pokemon.   
This can be changed to drop on defeating any pokemon, bosses, or shinies.

This mod is only required on the server, client is optional.
